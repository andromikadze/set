# SET
Card game 'Set' for 1-4 players, developed in WPF.

## KEY FEATURES
- GUI automatically scales up to the resolution of the computer executing the application.
- Automatically shuffles and deals cards to the table with animation.
- Automatically finishes game if/when no set can be found on the table.
- Open menu by pressing the table. Finish game early or restart game in the menu.

## DOWNLOAD
1. Simply download the 'Set.exe' file to your computer.
2. If blocked, unblock the application in its properties (no virus, I promise).
3. For best experience, play on a 360-degree laptop facing upwards, with touch screen.

## GAME RULES
- Each card has 4 properties: number, shape, shading, color.
- Find a set of three cards from the table that satisfies ALL of these conditions:
    1. They all have the same number or have three different numbers.
    2. They all have the same shape or have three different shapes.
    3. They all have the same shading or have three different shadings.
    4. They all have the same color or have three different colors.
- Every set is rewarded with a point to the player who found it.
- An incorrect set resets the score for the player who found it.
- The player with the highest score when the deck runs out wins.
